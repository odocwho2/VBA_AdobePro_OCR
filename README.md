# VBA_AdobePro_OCR
This vba scrit can be used with Adobe PDF Pro to loop to files that have OCR applied over them to read each word.  
If a match is found we can use VBA again to export the specific data to an Excel file.  
This exemple was optimized to loop through the pages going from last to first.  
In my specific case the word was always found on the N-1 page number.
